1) Clean all file/folders that aren't tracked by git
	- Normally, you'll keep every file in the root directory
	- Normally, you should only keep the "site" and "src" folders
	- Keep a copy of the "dist" folder if you want - it'll be easier to detect the changes in the "dist" HTML files after the upgrade to see what you need to update in the website's template files
2) Update the versions in package.json and bower.json
	- Also update the versions of the two devDependencies (in bower.json) for "wet-boew" and "GCWeb"
3) npm install
4) grunt init
5) grunt dist

6) Compare the GCWeb branch of the previous version to the version which you're upgrading
	- Use BeyondCompare to identify files that changed
	- Merge the changes (if applicable) into local files that we've modified/overwritten in gcweb-opc
7) Compare the wet-boew branch of the previous version to the version which you're upgrading
	- Use BeyondCompare to identify files that changed in "site" only
	- Merge the changes (if applicable) into local files that we've modified/overwritten in gcweb-opc

8) grunt dist
9) grunt server (optional if you want to test the HTML files and/or keep tweaking and re-generating the site following the changes)
